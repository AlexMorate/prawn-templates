Support for templates was dropped in Prawn 0.13.0, 
disabled by default in 0.14.0, and extracted in 0.15.0.

This gem includes the extracted templates code, which is completely 
unsupported, but provides the old functionality that was in
Prawn 0.12.0 for years.

Templates were originally written by James Healy, but are no
longer actively maintained by anyone. Use at your own risk,
or volunteer to help maintain the code on the Prawn
Mailing list:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prawn-ruby

Keep in mind the reason that this gem was extracted is because the 
code is very buggy! For a list of old issues that were affecting
it, see Prawn's tracker:
